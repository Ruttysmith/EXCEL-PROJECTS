I recently wrapped up a big analytics project where I explored and visualized bank loan performance, diving deep into MTD (Month-to-Date), MOM (Month-on-Month), and PMTD (Previous Month-to-Date) calculations.

This dashboard goes beyond raw data. It shows:
âœ… Total loan applications (38.6K+)
âœ… Funded vs. received amounts (\$435M+ vs. \$473M+)
âœ… Average interest rates & debt-to-income ratio
âœ… Good vs. bad loan distribution (86% vs. 14%)
âœ… Loan performance by state, purpose, term & employment length

What excites me most about this work is turning complexity into clarity. With just a glance, decision-makers can see how loans are performing, identify risk areas, and understand the health of their portfolio.

 Imagine a bank executive using this dashboard, they donâ€™t need to crunch numbers; they can instantly see insights like:

* Which loans are performing well
* How much money is actually being recovered
* Where default risks are highest

This project reminded me why I love data analytics: it transforms decisions, fuels growth, and reduces risk.

 If youâ€™re a business leader, financial analyst, or aspiring data professional, insights like these show just how much power lies in analyzing the right metrics.
