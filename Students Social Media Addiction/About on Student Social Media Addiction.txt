About Dataset
Overview
The Student Social Media & Relationships dataset contains anonymized records of students’ social‐media behaviors and related life outcomes. It spans multiple countries and academic levels, focusing on key dimensions such as usage intensity, platform preferences, and relationship dynamics. Each row represents one student’s survey response, offering a cross‐sectional snapshot suitable for statistical analysis and machine‐learning applications.

Scope & Coverage
Population: Students aged 16–25 enrolled in high school, undergraduate, or graduate programs.
Geography: Multi‐country coverage (e.g., Bangladesh, India, USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Japan, South Korea).
Timeframe: Data collected via a one‐time online survey administered in Q1 2025.
Volume: Configurable sample sizes (e.g., 100, 500, 1,000 records) based on research needs.
Data Collection & Methodology
Survey Design: Questions adapted from validated scales on social‐media addiction (e.g., Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale) and relationship conflict indices.

Recruitment: Participants recruited through university mailing lists and social‐media platforms, ensuring diversity in academic level and country.

Data Quality Controls:

Validation: Mandatory fields and range checks (e.g., usage hours between 0–24).
De‐duplication: Removal of duplicate entries via unique Student_ID checks.
Anonymization: No personally identifiable information collected.

Potential Analyses
Correlation Studies: Examine associations between daily usage hours and mental‐health score or sleep hours.
Predictive Modeling: Build classifiers to predict relationship conflicts based on usage patterns and platform type.
Clustering: Identify user segments (e.g., “high‐usage high‐stress” vs. “moderate‐usage balanced”) across countries.
Limitations
Self‐Report Bias: All measures are self‐reported and may be subject to social‐desirability effects.
Cross‐Sectional Design: One‐time survey prevents causal inference.
Sampling Variability: Recruitment via online channels may underrepresent students with limited internet access.


About this file

Suggest Edits
This CSV file contains survey responses from students aged 16–25 across multiple countries, capturing their social media usage patterns alongside key personal, academic, and well-being indicators. It is structured for easy import into statistical software or data-science environments and includes both quantitative and categorical fields to enable exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and reporting on the relationships between social media addiction and various life outcomes.

Column Descriptions
Student_ID
A unique integer identifier assigned to each survey respondent to enable de-duplication and track individual records without revealing personal information.

Age
The student’s age in completed years at the time of the survey, used to segment analysis by age group and control for developmental differences.

Gender
The student’s self-reported gender, recorded as “Male” or “Female” to allow for demographic breakdowns in usage and outcome measures.

Academic_Level
The highest level of education the respondent is currently enrolled in, with categories: “High School,” “Undergraduate,” or “Graduate,” facilitating stratified analyses by academic stage.

Country
The country of residence where the student completed the survey, enabling cross-country comparisons of social media behaviors and impacts.

Avg_Daily_Usage_Hours
The average number of hours per day the student spends on social media platforms, calculated from self-reported weekday and weekend usage estimates.

Most_Used_Platform
The social media platform on which the student spends the most time (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, TikTok), used to examine platform-specific effects.

Affects_Academic_Performance
A binary indicator (“Yes”/“No”) reflecting whether the student perceives their social media use as having a negative impact on their academic performance.

Sleep_Hours_Per_Night
The respondent’s average nightly sleep duration in hours, provided to investigate correlations between screen time and sleep quality/quantity.

Mental_Health_Score
A self-rated integer from 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent) indicating overall mental well-being, allowing assessment of potential associations with social media habits.

Relationship_Status
The student’s current romantic relationship status, categorized as “Single,” “In Relationship,” or “Complicated,” to explore social media’s impact on interpersonal dynamics.

Conflicts_Over_Social_Media
The number of arguments or disagreements the student reports having had with family, friends, or partners due to their social media use, serving as a proxy for social friction.

Addicted_Score
A composite score from 1 (low addiction) to 10 (high addiction) based on a standardized survey scale (e.g., Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale), quantifying the degree of problematic usage.
